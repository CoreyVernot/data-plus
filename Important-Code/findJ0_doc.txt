findJ0



Description:

This function returns a 2-column data frame of an ID and the first timeunit the ID was recorded purchasing any prescriptions for a specified medical condition. In a way, it is a more general version of findK0(). It requires a week to timeunit (4-week period) conversion chart to be in the working directory. This is only used within the getPanelIDs() function, and only if only_first_rx is TRUE. This function is run once for each entry in the ellipse argument.
