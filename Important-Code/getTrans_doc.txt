  Description:
    Connects to two databases, merges getNut() and getFood(), and returns a dataframe of nutritions, transaction dates, upc, 
    food categories, serving sizes, ounces, and fluid ounces for each individual.
  Arguments:
    ShowFoodOptions
      User friendly options of whether to choose food categories. 
      If TRUE, choose food categories interactively in console panel from getFoodList(); otherwise, all food categories in FoodType
      argument are included.
    ShowNutrientOptions
      User friendly options of whether to choose nutrients.
      If TRUE, choose nutritions interactively in console panel from the given nutrition list; otherwise, all nutritions in Nutrition
      argument are included.
    ShowYearOptions
      User friendly options of whether to choose years.
      If TRUE, choose years (without centuries) in console panel from the given year list; otherwise, all years in Year argument are included.
    FoodType
      Character vector of all food categories in getFoodList()
    Nutrition
      Character vector of all nutritions in the database
    PanelIDs
      Numeric vector of individuals' ids from getPanelIDs()
    becr_server
      Character string for name of ODBC server which consists of nutrition information
    iri_server
      Character string for name of ODBC server which consists of transaction information in retail stores
  Examples:
    #get rx and demo from getRx() and getDemo()
    rx <- getRx()
    demo <- getDemo()
    #get individuals' ids from getPanelIDs()
    B11 <- "Metformin"
    B21 <- "ALLOPURINOL"; B22 <- "COSOPT"
    D1 <- c(B11)
    D2 <- c(B21,B22)
    panelids <- getPanelIDs(D1,D2, rx=rx, demo=demo, HHSize = 1)
    #plug panelids in getTrans()
    transT <- getTrans(ShowFoodOptions = T,ShowNutrientOptions = T,ShowYearOptions = T,PanelIDs = panelids[["IDs"]][[1]])
    transF <- getTrans(FoodType = c("BFLS","SNACKS"), Nutrition = c("calories","cholesterol"), Year = 9:12, PanelIDs = panelids[["IDs"]][[2]])
